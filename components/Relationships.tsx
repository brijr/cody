					It was an honor and pleasure to work with Cody while he managed our community with Avalon
					Senior Living. Rarely do you find at the VP level a leader who leads by example and
					empowers employees to do their best without micromanagement. Cody communicated the goals,
					mission and overall objectives and came through with the support and tools to succeed. I
					would gladly collaborate with this professional any day because he truly exemplifies the
					qualities of leadership and caring for all stakeholders.
